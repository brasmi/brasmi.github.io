# How-to template

!!! info
    This template includes writing instructions and boilerplate text you can customize, indicated in {curly brackets}. Make sure you replace the placeholders with your own text.

## Introduction

{A how-to guide is task oriented, the goal being to help the user get something done. Written from the perspective of the user, the guide aims for a successful result by showing the user what they need to do to obtain the desired result.}

This guide explains how to {insert brief description of the task}. {Mention any high-level steps and call out any assumptions}. 

{Optional: Specify when and why the user should perform the task.}

### Prerequisites

{Format prerequisites into a bulleted list, calling out any required tools, access, knowledge, or steps that must be completed before starting this guide.}

Before you start, ensure:

* Prerequisite 1
* Prerequisite 2
* Prerequisite 3

## {Action-oriented task description (Ex: Configuring a network switch)}

{Provide a concise description for the purpose of the task if it is not clear from the task title.}

1. {This is the first step. Use a verb to start.}

    {Optional: explanatory text}

    {Optional: code sample or screenshot that helps the user complete this step.}

    {Optional: an example result of completing this step.}

2. {This is the second step. Use a verb to start.}

    2.1 {Substep 1}

    2.2 {Substep 2}

### {Sub-task (Ex: Setting an IP from console)}

{Notice the sub-task title is a heading 3. The sub-task section is entirely optional. Include a sub-task only if the task is complex enough to have more than 10 steps. If you feel the need to break the tasks down even further, consider whether the task deserves its own doc.}
